<p> 
	For the first time in four years, drug overdose deaths are down across New York City, according to data from the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief142.pdf"> New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene</a>. In October, city officials announced that overdose deaths fell from 3,070 in 2022 to 3,046 in 2023, a 1% decrease.

</script>
</div>

<p>
	According to the DOH data, the number of overdose deaths decreased by 15 from 2022 to 2023 in the Bronx. Manhattan was the only borough that had an increase in the rate (35 overdose deaths), but it was still lower overall compared to the Bronx. 
</p>

<p>
	“The overdose epidemic does not hit every community equally,” said <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/teresa-lopez-castro?srsltid=AfmBOoog1hcCgcOf9bf5xeQTw_QgX-tLHhkgONXwywGM_7-R0aI5hM9Y"> Teresa López-Castro</a>, a professor at The City College of New York who works with and researches the impact of harm reduction organizations on communities like East Harlem. “In these communities, where historically there have been many structural barriers to access to quality treatment, we’re going to see the harms related to the overdose epidemic remain there until these barriers are properly lifted.”
</p>

<p>
	López-Castro explained that these barriers include the criminalization approach to the care of people who use drugs, which can limit access to evidence-based treatments such as medications for opioid use disorder. Socially disenfranchised, under-resourced neighborhoods are hit especially hard.
